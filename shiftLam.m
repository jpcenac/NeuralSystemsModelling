%shiftLam.m
%Makes connectivity matrix MX by laminating shifted versions of the 
%same row vector rv that contains the desired connectivity profile

function MX = shiftLam(rv) % declare the function

[dum, nUnits] = size(rv); % find the number of units in the network

for i = 1:nUnits % for each unit in the network
    MX(i,:) = rv; %set its row of the weight matrix to the profile
    rv = [rv(nUnits) rv(1:nUnits-1)]; %shift the profile
